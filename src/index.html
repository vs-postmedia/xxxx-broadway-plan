					<li class="step" data>
						<p>Developers are proposing 50 new projects along the Broadway SkyTrain extension that would add over <span class="bold">7,200 new housing units</span> – including 1,300 below market units – to three neighbourhoods. <span class="scroll-more">Scroll for more...</span></p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>While the proposals would lead to a massive increase in housing, roughly <span class="bold">450 units</span> of existing housing would be demolished for <span class="blue-01">several redevelopments</span>, according to a Postmedia analysis.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>Nearly half of the proposed developments are in Mount Pleasant, which would gain over 3,300 new <span class="blue-01">mixed-use housing</span> units after accounting for the more than 170 existing units that will be lost when old homes or apartments are torn down. <span class="bold">Eleven per cent</span> of the new units would be priced below market.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>A number of <span class="purple-01">office</span> and <span class="grey-02">industrial</span> buildings have also been proposed, mostly in the northeast of Mount Pleasant, near E. 2nd Ave.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>Fairview could gain nearly <span class="bold">2,500 new housing units</span> after accounting for the roughly 200 existing units lost from redevelopment. Almost <span class="bold">20 per cent</span> of of the new units would be priced below market rates.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>The only residential development that was under construction as of March 21 is the 39-storey tower that will sit atop the South Granville SkyTrain station.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>Kitsilano could gain nearly 1,400 new units, including two <span class="green-01">dedicated residental</span> towers with more than 180 units each. Only <span class="bold">seven per cent</span> of the new units in Kits would be below market.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="step">
						<p>A handful of proposals include <span class="purple-01">childcare spaces</span> for <span class="bold">more than 125 children</span>. Details on the amount of spaces are unavailable for three proposals, two of which are not shown here because the locations of the proposed developments haven’t been made public yet.</p>
